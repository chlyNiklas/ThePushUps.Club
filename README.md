# ThePushUps.Club

## Rules
- Anytime, anywhere, any member of the club may assign 20 push-ups to another member. Requests from different members are cumulative.
- You have 60 seconds to find a suitable spot, get on the ground, and start. You may not rise until the task is complete.
- Once a member assigned another, neither of them may assign to the other for one hour. Requests from/to others are allowed.

## Ten Principles
### Benevolence & Kindness (no vengeance)
The aim of the club is to propagate happiness, health, and fun. Push-ups should never be used to humiliate, degrade or retaliate. Giving push-ups should be done in a benevolent manner, meaning it should not be done to make fun of someone, but to have fun with them.

### Immediacy
As we aim to reconnect the world and promote human connection, push-ups should be given in person, preferably with direct visual contact. This is about connection, not showing off.

### Consent & Respect
Be mindful of other people's feelings. If it does not feel right, then it isn't.

### Promote Health
20 push-ups is just a suggestion. A different number of push-ups or equivalent exercises (e.g., pull-ups, squats, crunches, planks, etc.) are welcome â€” if you're brave enough to create a comparison table, submit a pull request. The founders admit to lacking the required nerdiness and/or motivation.

### Radical Inclusion
Anyone may be part of the club, feeling welcome and respected by everyone. Feel free to adapt the rules to your needs, limitations, and goals.

### Creativity
It's about quality, not quantity. Generate shared memories, not digital likes. Surprise and silliness matter more than stats.

### No Time Tracking
Don't over-engineer it, don't clock the time, as it reduces the surprise and fun factors. It isn't about retaliating asap or maximizing the number of push-ups. It's about the fun behind it. The risk is turning it into a countdown game just to avoid being assigned push-ups.

## We Be/live in Open-Source
- Feel free to fork the concept to your own needs, business, or activity.

## Secret Agenda of the Founders
- Being able to do my push-ups while waiting for my bus without looking weird.
- Seeing hundreds of people doing push-ups in the Geneva city center.
- With utmost respect... making my boss do push-ups.
- Being given push-ups by Obama.
