# ThePushUps.Club

## Rules
- Any member of the group may order any other member to do 20 push-ups, at any time, at any place, which are cumulative.
- You have 60 seconds to find the perfect spot.
- If someone gives push-ups to someone else, neither can give each other push-ups before one hour has passed.

## Ten Principles
### Benevolence & Kindness (no vengeance)
The aim of the club is to propagate happiness, health, and fun. Therefore, giving push-ups should be done in a benevolent manner, meaning it should not be done to make fun of or degrade someone, but to have fun with them.

### Immediacy
As we aim to reconnect the world and promote human connection, push-ups should be given in person, preferably with direct visual contact. This is about connection, not showing off.

### Consent & Respect
Be mindful of other people's feelings. If it does not feel right, then it isn't.

### Promote Health
20 push-ups is a suggestion. It can be translated to pull-ups, squats, planks, or any equivalent exercise. (Comparison table -> "We do not have the required nerdiness to achieve such complex calculations. If you feel confident, please provide a PR").

### Radical Inclusion
Anyone may be part of the club, feeling welcome and respected by everyone. Feel free to adapt the rules to your needs, limitations, and goals.

### Creativity
It's about quality, not quantity. Generate shared memories, not digital likes.

### No Time Tracking
Don't over-engineer it. It isn't about performance, as that may reduce the surprise and fun factors. It isn't about maximizing the number of push-ups done, but promoting the fun behind it.
